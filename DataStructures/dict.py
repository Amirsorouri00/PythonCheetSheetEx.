# Dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers 
# can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, 
# or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it 
# cannot be used as a key. You canâ€™t use lists as keys, since lists can be modified 
# in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and extend().
